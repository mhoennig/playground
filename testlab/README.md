# Testlab

My Kubernetes testlab runs in [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) on my Linux Laptop, thus in virtual machines.
With Rancher Desktop based on dockerd it also provides the Docker daemon, which I still need, besides the Kubernetes cluster.
I use my testlab mostly for learning and experimenting.

My Kubernetes homelab, on the other hand, runs [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) on bare metal (a bunch of mini PCs).
It's mostly used for my local CI/CD system, currently with Jenkins.
